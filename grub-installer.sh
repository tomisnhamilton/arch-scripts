# Developer Notes:

# Ensure that Windows parition / drive is detected by grub

# - Is the EFI for Windows boot in the /boot?
# - If so, why? And how to remedy for reinstalls

# Answer: 
# - YES, not sure why, but Microsoft seems to use the default EFI bootloader which would be the Arch oneâ€¦ hence the 2 partitions when installing Windows# 

# Moving forward: 
# - Ensure that the EFI or boot partition is always saved and never deleted!
# - Or, reinstall everything with Windows being first.
